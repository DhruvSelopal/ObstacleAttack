Make sure toa add in the specific values for all platforms provided in the exel file "values", i was facing some glitches so i created a vlues file so that the game 
would run perfectly on adding those values .
c++ diversify the possiblilties of unreal. Using oops came in handy, a single funtion was capable of moving multiple objects in unreal.
Loking forward on creating more defined games and infinite possible outcomes .
Couldnt have learned oops better than practically using it . I really wish to ppublish a game by the end of this year , and git hub as usual will help me keep a record
of my progress . Thank you for sticking around ( thou i have 0 followers).
