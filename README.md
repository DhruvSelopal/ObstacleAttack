c++ diversifies the possiblilties of unreal. Using oops came in handy, a single funtion was capable of moving multiple objects in unreal.
Loking forward on creating more defined games and infinite possible outcomes .
Couldnt have learned oops better than practically using it . I really wish to ppublish a game by the end of this year , and git hub as usual will help me keep a record
of my progress . Thank you for sticking around ( thou i have 0 followers).
